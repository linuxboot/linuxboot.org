# Linux as Firmware

**Tired of reinventing the wheel by implementing drivers for firmware again and again.**</br>
**Not with LinuxBoot!**

### What?

LinuxBoot is a firmware for modern servers that replaces specific firmware
functionality like the UEFI DXE phase with a Linux kernel and runtime.

### Why?

*   Improves boot reliability by replacing lightly-tested firmware drivers with
    hardened Linux drivers.
*   Improves boot time by removing unnecessary code. Typically makes boot 20
    times faster.
*   Allows customization of the initrd runtime to support site-specific needs
    (both device drivers as well as custom executables).
*   Proven approach for almost 20 years in military, consumer electronics, and
    supercomputing systems -- wherever reliability and performance are
    paramount.
